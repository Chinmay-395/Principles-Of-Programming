# Steps for adding different features

for language extension:

Syntax

- Concrete Syntax: rules you have to follow to filter out incorrect code
- Abstract Syntax:

Semantics â†’ is how we run code

- Specification
    - Results
    - Evaluation Judgements
    - Evaluation rules
- Implementation

using parse  in utop you can convert from conceret to abstract syntax
